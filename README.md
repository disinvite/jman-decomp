# _The Journeyman Project Turbo!_ Decompilation

[_The Journeyman Project Turbo!_](https://www.mobygames.com/game/804/the-journeyman-project-turbo/) is a 1994 first-person graphic adventure game from Presto Studios. It is a retooling of the 1993 title [_The Journeyman Project_](https://www.mobygames.com/game/22007/the-journeyman-project/) that used the [MacroMind Director](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Director) platform. Not to be confused with [_The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime_](https://www.mobygames.com/game/23526/the-journeyman-project-pegasus-prime/), the 1997 remake.

This project will decompile the Windows 3.1 version of _The Journeyman Project Turbo!_ (_JMAN_) to enable porting to [ScummVM](https://scummvm.org/) or other platforms.
